When we leave this all

remember why we were there,

for all

of those who care

it might be a blessing,

though vainly disguised.

But when we get out, we may find something

to gain

something to lose,

either way it’s the same.

Because when you think about it,

there is much more for the white

and less for the blues

as if anything said through clenched teeth

could ever be good news.

So not for monotony,

but I think I may have had a damn good time.

And the dichotomy is sharply seen

at this point of the line,

where the credits are rolling over.

So for those traveling far

remember the faces that you are

and crack a smile

lest someone crack it for you.

Do please let the feelings go

and make sure they never know

where you hid your gold.

Until then

time and again

keep what is fleeting

because permanent things hurt

the most.

–*a toast*–
