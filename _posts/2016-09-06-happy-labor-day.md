#### If you’re in America

Today was Labor Day — and many of you probably won’t be reading this until it’s no longer Labor day. That’s okay with me, because I just wanted to reach out and say something tangentially related to the holiday, but that is hopefully evergreen.

Don’t work too hard. Seriously. And I think each one of you — if you’re honest with yourself — knows what “too hard” means. Your time and attention are like money, in that you need to have some left over for things you didn’t anticipate. Except, you *can’t* make more time and attention; you have what you have, and that’s it.

I’m not telling you this because I follow the advice, and I can show you how to do it (with my free e-book, and courses that are just $29 each!). I’m telling you this because I work too much. I work at a jobby-job, and write an egregious amount here on [Medium](https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6). I leave really no time and attention for anything else. So everything that wasn’t scheduled or anticipated trips me up, freaks me out.

Whatever you think about labor unions, their original purpose was to make sure that our lives did not just disappear into work. The least we can do is just *think* about that.

That’s all I’ve got.

Godspeed.
