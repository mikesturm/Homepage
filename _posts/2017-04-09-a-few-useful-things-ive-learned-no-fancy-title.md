<figure class="wp-caption">![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*rQv160RDYScy9Qw04RYZeg.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">credit: [Pok Rie](https://www.pexels.com/u/pok-rie-33563/)</figcaption></figure>- **There is a difference between *having* an opinion, *voicing* that opinion, and *acting on* that opinion.**  
    Everyone is entitled to their opinion. But opinions should be handled with care. We must understand that an opinion merely possessed is easy to remedy — you can change your mind. But an opinion voiced or acted upon is much more difficult to remedy.
- **Doing a lot, and quickly, is overrated** The person who does 10 things quickly, and with little thought, often ends up:  
    – not needing to have done 5 of those things  
    – having to fix or take back 3 of them  
    – being unsure in retrospect about 2 of them
- **Thinking big often means acting small** In fact, those who ACT big are often actually thinking small. They’re reacting to the latest and loudest things. They’re grabbing on to trends, trailing indicators, and reactions.   
    Thinking big means knowing that everything big begins small, and that only smaller, well thought-out actions over time will win sustained, repeatable results.
- **Feelings are results, too** It happens all the time — metrics are not met, promises are not kept, or results are not delivered. But the way you are able to make someone feel about you and your efforts — even when you don’t deliver the results — can make all the difference. This means that you are responsible for much more than meeting expectations. You are responsible for making your customer, partner, or whoever feel genuinely good — even when you couldn’t come through for them as promised or expected.  
       
    This doesn’t mean you can half-ass it and just charm your way out of it — people tend to be able to sense that pretty easily after it happens once or twice. Rather, you have to come by the trust and good will honestly — by being forthcoming, honest, and genuinely caring about those you serve. There’s no trick to it.
- **Everything in moderation — even moderation** Sometimes, you have to be passionate, other times reserved and detached. If you are always down the middle, unexcitable, cool and collected, you’re basically almost a robot. Moderation also needs to be moderated. A full life will include ups and downs — and honest reactions will mirror those ups and downs.   
       
    For the most part, try to keep your cool. But cool is not really meant to be kept forever. You should get excited sometimes, sad at other times. That is how human life works. Don’t pretend you can completely transcend it — you wouldn’t really want to anyway, it would be terribly boring.
