So I’m scrolling down a story today, and what do I see?

<figure class="wp-caption">![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*P7yVj0fLBSo1on0quL5TDQ.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The sidebar. Yes, this is my own story. Don’t judge.</figcaption></figure>Not intrusive, just enough to catch your eye, but not enough to distract from the story. Smooth, [Medium](https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6) peeps, very smooth.

Keep on keepin’ on. I like where this train is going.

Love,

Mike
