#### A Poem

<figure class="wp-caption">![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rgdPQsyBK7sHzJryavuOtQ.jpeg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Public Domain</figcaption></figure>I say  
I *do* say  
If I do say so myself.

Do you say?  
Does *who* say?  
If I say, I betray my stealth.

I am, a gamble  
For lack of bettors  
or just better  
whether a writer, or mere typesetter.

I am, then

The best of of what the worst could be  
The rest of what there used to be  
The nest from which so few can see  
Don’t waste your strength to get to me  
Because there is no *me*, you see?

They say the most romantic men were genocidal  
I say that most permanence is tidal  
Truth, then what?  
Truth, then what?!

When I say  
What *you* say  
It gets around  
To you.

It does, but when?

In due time  
In whose time?  
Undoubtedly, a fool’s time.
