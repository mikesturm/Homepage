So, this week, I decided that aside from publishing my stuff in others’ publications, I’d make my own publication as well. I’m glad that you have hopped aboard my train.

I’m not entirely sure what this will be, yet, but I hope that it’ll be something that you find valuable. That is my overarching goal — to bring value to those who read my writing. I aim to do this by exploring interesting ideas, and offering my take on them — at least my take *at that particular time*.

If you have any thoughts about things you’d like to see me put in print, feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:mike@yourfool.com).

Thanks for hopping aboard!
