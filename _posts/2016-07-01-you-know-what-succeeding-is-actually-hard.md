#### So can our Medium writers please just act accordingly?

<figure class="wp-caption">![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PWn6o4xVGkieewMdjpLhuw.jpeg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The work is slow and difficult.</figcaption></figure>I’ve been on Medium for just over a year now. I try to split my time between reading and writing. I write about creativity, productivity, and generally just trying to be a better person. I try to read the same kind of stuff.

But lately, I’ve noticed two disconnects. First, there is just *way* too much content flying at me. It’s all about self-improvement. It likely all means well. However, it seems to just be the same stuff over and over.

Be a lifelong learner. Set Goals. Get up early and do a bunch of stuff in the morning. Take risks. The list goes on. [As I’ve already noted](https://medium.com/self-starter/its-happened-medium-posts-have-repeated-themselves-d74aec06e512#.eg4xsb62h), I’ve begun to see repetition in the subject matter of articles, even within the same publication.

The second disconnect I’ve noticed is that the tone of these articles tends to be something like this: success is easy, you do what this article says, and you’re on your way. But clearly, this is not the case, right? Succeeding in life is hard. We can agree on that, right? Also, luck plays an outsized role in how well people end up doing. There are many things that can end up snapping into place at the right time, and that can help people who working no harder than other unlucky schmucks end up getting to the next level. I just don’t see that acknowledged in many of these articles. Perhaps my feed on Medium is just broken.

Perhaps I’d just be less likely to complain, if one or both of the following happened:

1. There were fewer self-improvement articles voiced in the second person on Medium.
2. The tone of the self-improvement articles was more honest about how difficult and reliant upon circumstance wild success is.

How likely are these things to happen? Perhaps someone really good at statistics can help tell me that. Now that’d be an article I would read.
