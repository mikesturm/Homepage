Hey everyone,

I have two quick notes, and won’t take up much of your time.

1. I am closing up *Your Fool Laureate*. I encourage you to follow a publication that my good friend, [Stephen M. Tomic](https://medium.com/u/b9d5f10bb3f3) and I have founded: [*The Junction*](https://medium.com/the-junction). It will be everything you’ve come to expect from me and then some.
2. I have had a newsletter for a while, but haven’t promoted it well. It’s picking up steam, and I’d like it if you could subscribe. Once per week, no spammy BS. It’s called “Woolgathering”. [Subscribe here.](http://tinyletter.com/mike_sturm)

Godspeed
