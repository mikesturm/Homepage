Writing should be clear. To write clearly, writers should strive to write as simply as possible. But there is a difference between simple writing and resorting to cheap shortcuts to make writing *appear* simple.

I see a lot of writing these days that consists of one sentence paragraphs. I think that many of the writers believe that such a scheme makes each sentence more powerful. They think it makes their piece easier to read for those who might be on the fence about it. I think it’s a bit lazy.

#### Words and Roadmaps

Writing is like driving across a state on a main highway. Paragraphs are like the towns you pass through. For the most part, you can tell when you’ve entered and left each one. The houses, restaurants, churches, and gas stations are generally grouped together. There are pretty clear boundaries. The same thing should hold true for the paragraphs you’re writing. One house and a bar is generally not a town; one sentence is generally not a paragraph. Don’t pretend otherwise.

I present that analogy because writers have a responsibility. It’s the same responsibility that you have when you’re the driver of a car, and you have a passenger. People who read your stuff are passengers in your vehicle. As such, you’re the navigator, you’re the tour guide, you’re the pilot. You are taking people somewhere, and they should never have to question if you’re lost, or whether you know where you’re going.

Tossing a bunch of one-sentence paragraphs at the readers is almost as bad as presenting them with long, meandering, circular sentences. It’s like deciding to take the “shortcut” road, only to find that it’s a winding back-road that gets you lost and wastes a bunch of time. Yes, one sentence paragraphs, one word sentences, and fragments all have their place every once and a while. None of these deviations from writing norms should be used just for the purpose of looking edgy. They should be broken for a particular purpose, but when they’re broken constantly, the purpose starts to get called into question.

#### Take Care

Writing is a balance between an art form and a means to an end. Words and sentences can be beautiful and awesome in and of themselves — like art. But words and sentences also attempt to convey meaning; they are a vehicle for expression and revelation. Writers need to respect the dual nature of writing, and take care to balance them.

They say that with great power comes great responsibility, but the converse holds true as well. With great responsibility comes great power. When you write responsibly, with care and concern for the craft and for your readers, your writing gains real power.

I guess I could be wrong, though. In which case:

Keep writing your one sentence paragraphs.

And your fragments.

And your weird. One. Word. Sentences.
