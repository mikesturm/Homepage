Because the Internet Loves Lists, and I’m Lazy

It is literally impossible to do both of the following things (a) Pick yourself up by the bootstraps; (b) Be self-made. That being the case, don’t be so cocky as to claim that you’ve done either, or suggest that others do so.
2. Everyone is pursuing what they view as good for them— some form of happiness or alleviation of their suffering. Don’t make the mistake of seeing others’ motives as bad or evil. At best, it shows you to be ignorant and superficial. At worst, it denies you the benefit of gaining a true understanding of your fellow humans.
3. You should be able to learn something from each person you converse with. It is not only enriching for you, but the purest form of respect for the other person.
4. If you believe that you haven’t made any mistakes by the day’s end, you’re either forgetful, lying to yourself, or simply not trying.
5. 95% of the time, the following will be true of any email, text, phone call, letter, tweet, post, or meeting: it can wait. Things will be fine without your immediate attention and reply to it.
6. A simple trick to weed out pathological liars: they are the ones claiming to know all of the answers.
7. Art exists because merely *speaking* the truth doesn’t convey the full gravity of it.
8. Almost always say 50% less than what you feel like saying at the time, with one exception: when you feel like telling someone how much you care about them.
9. A plan is essential to have, if only so that you can easily recognize how much and how often things don’t turn out according to it.
10. Do not confuse **Simple** with **Easy**. The simplest things are some of the most difficult ones.
