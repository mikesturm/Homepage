On June 20, I finally saw it in my feed. Two posts from two well-known writers popped up in my feed. They were basically the same:

<figure>![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BT-Yg7HoVg26h2mkjmU9oA.png)</figure>Is this what it’s come to on Medium? Is this what I’ve been “missing” in the past 3 weeks or so since I’ve been gone?

Shit.

This isn’t a good sign. Maybe I was right to check out for a while. But maybe I’m wrong. Maybe this is just in the zeitgeist. Maybe Holiday and Faroux were just tapped into that jetstream of inspiration. Maybe *The Mission* was launching (pun *fully* intended) a prompt for famous internet people to pen articles on the same title — except I was unable to find it (which isn’t saying much, I’ll grant you).

Or maybe originality — or at least a frail attempt at it — doesn’t mean anything anymore. Maybe no one will read this. Check that — no one will read this.

Anyway, I was just thinking out loud. You can go back to whatever it was you were doing now.
